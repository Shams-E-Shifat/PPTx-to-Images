# thumbnail_generator_V1
Developed for specific work. More improvement will be done in future.

## very brief tutorial:
 must be run from command prompt or powershell.
 syntax format: thumbnail_generator.exe --[options]
              There are two options:
                option1: fix
                    This option tries to fix the text formatting of slides as much as possible.
                option2: export
                    This option exports all the presentation files to images by folder
              
              Sample execution: thumbnail_generator.exe --export
