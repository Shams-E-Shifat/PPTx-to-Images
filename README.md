# thumbnail_generator_V1
Developed for specific work. More improvement will be done in future.

## very brief tutorial:
 must be run from command prompt or powershell.<br>
 syntax format: <br><p>`thumbnail_generator.exe --[option]`</p><br>
              There are two options:
              <ul>
                <li>
                option1: `fix` <br>
                    This option tries to fix the text formatting of slides as much as possible.<br>
                    (Not stable right now)
                 </li>
                <li>
                option2: `export` <br>
                    This option exports all the presentation files to images by folder
                 (Stable and works fine)
               </li>
              </ul>
              Sample execution: `thumbnail_generator.exe --export`
